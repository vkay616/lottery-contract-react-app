# lottery-contract-react-app

This is a Smart Contract for a Lottery built on Sepolia Test Network using Solidity and React.js

Anyone can enter the lottery as long as they pay more than 0.01 ether, and the manager aka the person who deployed the smart contract can then pick a winner, all the ether in the contract will then be transferred to the lucky winner!

P.S: This project was a part of the course - Ethereum and Solidity: The Developer's Guide from Stephen Grider available on Udemy.
